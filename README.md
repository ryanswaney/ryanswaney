# Hello world

I’m **Ryan Swaney** (he/him), an interdisciplinary web developer and graphic designer from the Midwest who now calls Brooklyn home. I got my start coding for the web around 1995-1996, mainly building websites about how much I loved playing Magic: The Gathering and Warhammer. Since 2004, I have had the fortune to work with clients in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors.

As a web developer I have a particular passion for the front-of-the-front-end. My expertise is anchored in core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and how to best to utilize them to craft digital experiences that are functional, visually appealing, performant, and accessible.
